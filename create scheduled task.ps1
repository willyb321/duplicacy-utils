# task options
#
# - WILL DELETE THE TASK IF IT ALREADY EXISTS!!!!
#
# - is enabled by default
# - do not run on batteries (preserve power). however, if the task is started (while plugged), it continues if
#       the user goes on battery (so that a backup would not be incomplete)
# - do not start a new backup until the previous one is finished
# - start a backup (but only one, not more) if the start-time has passed (eg: start-time = 16:00, computer is
#       only powered on @ 18:21. backup starts @ 18:21)
# - don't wake the computer to run the task (as mentioned above, the task will run whenever the computer is
#       turned on and plugged, even after it's normal start time)
# - the task will run for at most 3 days continuously before being quit (Task Scheduler constraint)
